    "# Pitch Spelling with Partitura\n",
    "\n",
    "Have you always been bad at spelling bee, do you find that spelling notes makes this even worse. Your time of struggling is over.... Today we going to teach a Model to learn how to *pitch* spell for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "Spelling a pitch relates to the system of naming notes by letters (A-G) and sharp(#) and flat (♭) signs - and sometimes double sharp and flat signs, resulting in names or 'spellings' like 'A♭', 'D#', 'F♭♭'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Translating between frequencies in Hz and such names is non-trivial. You need to consider :\n",
    "\n",
    "- The 'concert pitch' you are taking as a reference\n",
    "- The temperament in which the piece is played\n",
    "- The overall key that the music would be notated in\n",
    "- Use of the correct enharmonic equivalents for accidentals (Using the correct enharmonic equivalent, Purpose of double-sharps and double-flats?)\n",
    "\n",
    "If translating between, say, MIDI note numbers and 'spelled' names, the first two steps can be skipped.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spelled pitch names often have an octave number appended for disambiguation - e.g. 'A♭3', 'D#5'.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Some Concrete Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "Different pitch spellings of the same content:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CPJKU/partitura_tutorial/main/static/chord_spelling.png \"Figure from Automatic Pitch Spelling, E. Cambouropoulos, 2001\")\n",
    "\n",
    "How to correctly spell a note may depend on the harmonic progression for example different spelling is appropriate for an *Augmented 6th* chord vs a borrowed dominant chord progression.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CPJKU/partitura_tutorial/main/static/augmented_6th_spelling.png \"Example of a Augmented 6th chord.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "If music theory is not your cup of tea, do not worry. We will view *Pitch Spelling* as a task from a more engineering perpective.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Some Spelling algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "Partitura contains an implementation for a standard algorithm for Pitch Spelling. The algorithm in question is called ps13 created by Meredith and al.:\n",
    "\n",
    "\tThe ps13 pitch spelling algorithm, D Meredith - Journal of New Music Research, 2006\n",
    "\n",
    "Some notable algorithms and current SOTA is PKSpell.\n",
    "\n",
    "\tPKSpell: Data-driven pitch spelling and key signature estimation\n",
    "\tF Foscarin, N Audebert, R Fournier-S'Niehotta, 2021\n",
    "\n",
    "### Let's Get Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we will use the following packages:\n",
    "- `partitura` The basic I/O for scores, performances and alignments crucial for pitch spelling estimation and evaluation.\n",
    "- Pytorch, i.e. `torch` Library for ML more on [https://pytorch.org/](https://pytorch.org/)\n",
    "- `pytorch_lightning` Wrappers for Pytorch for better visualization and encapsulation more on [https://www.pytorchlightning.ai/](https://www.pytorchlightning.ai/)\n",
    "- `pandas` for reading `.tsv` files\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by downloading ASAP a dataset containing note alignments of symbolic performances to their respective scores perfect for a Pitch-Spelling evaluation framework."
